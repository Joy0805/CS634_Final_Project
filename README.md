# CS634_Final_Project
The project is about Kaggle competition - RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge provided in https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge. 

## Introduction
- 
- The objective of the analysis is to locate the lung opacity on chest radiographs and diagnose pneumonia. 

## Overview
- Load pneumonia locations
- Analyze chest radiographs
- Create methods for data training
- Predict on validation
- Predict on test set

## Step 1 - Collect information about pneumonia locations from csv file


## Step 2 - Show information about chest radiographs


## Step 3 - Define Class and methods


## Step 4 - Create train and validation generators


## Step 5 - Plot


## Step 6 - Show Prediction on validation


## Step 7 - Predict
